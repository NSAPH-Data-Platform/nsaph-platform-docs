## What data are you adding?

There are many ways to add data to teh database. We review the following 
options:

- Creating a new data domain with its own pipelines and, optionally,
    software tools written in a programming language like Python, Java, R,
    Pl/PgSQL, etc.,
- Adding a new table:
    - from a file on file system
    - from remote data source
- Adding data to existing table
- Bulk ingesting multiple CSV-like files (we support many formats) from
    local file system to create a lightweight data domain

For creating new tables in teh database, there is a choice between
manually creating a data model and required data conversions and
transformations or automatically inferring data structure based on 
data sampling.
              
## Data modelling vs data introspection

Tools for data modelling are discussed in 
[](common/core-platform/doc/Datamodels.md). 

Examples of manually created data models are data models for
[Medicare](common/cms/doc/Medicare.md) and 
[Medicaid](common/cms/doc/Medicaid.md) domains. Actual models are defined
respectively in 
[](common/cms/doc/members/medicare_yaml.md) and
[](common/cms/doc/members/medicaid_yaml.md)

To automatically infer data structure by analyzing sample data
and generating data model corresponding to the existing structure
one can use
[Introspector tool](common/core-platform/doc/members/introspector.rst).
It can be run as a standalone command-line tool or used via Python API.                                                   
Examples of using introspector via API can be found in 
[EPA pipeline](common/epa/doc/members/registry.rst). 

[Project Loader Tool](common/core-platform/doc/ProjectLoader.md)
also uses Introspector.

## Adding new data domain

To add a new data domain one create a new repository on GitHub
or other source control system

                              
## Adding data to existing table

The process of adding data to an existing table is described in
[](common/core-platform/doc/DataLoader.md)

## Creating new single table

In many cases, creating a new single table will mean running a 
pipeline that first 
[introspects the data](common/core-platform/doc/members/introspector.rst) 
in a file (CSV, JSON, FST and some other
formats) and then running the 
[Data Loader](common/core-platform/doc/DataLoader.md).

## Automatically ingesting multiple files from a file system

See [Project Loader Tool](common/core-platform/doc/ProjectLoader.md)
for details.
